# Limitations and Non Goals

## Purpose

This document explicitly states what the Legal Anonymizer does not do.

This is important for transparency and risk management.

## Known Limitations

- Context dependent identifiers may be missed
- OCR errors may introduce false positives
- Adversarial inputs are not mitigated

---

## Non Goals

- Automated legal decision making
- Replacement for human review
- Prevention of deliberate re identification
- Real time surveillance or monitoring

---

## Responsibility

Users remain responsible for:
- Appropriateness of anonymisation

## Continuous Improvement

Limitations should be reviewed as:
- New file types are added
- New models are integrated
- Regulatory guidance evolves
