# Run Artifacts and Outputs

## Purpose

This document explains every artifact generated by an anonymization run.
It describes what each file contains, why it exists, and how it should be handled.

This document is essential for:
- audits
- legal review
- internal governance
- reproducibility

---

## Overview of a Run Folder

Each anonymization run produces a dedicated folder.

Example structure:

- run_id/
  - output/
  - logs/
  - preset_used.json
  - model_inventory.json
  - run_report.json
  - findings.csv
  - input_manifest.json

The run folder is immutable once created.

---

## preset_used.json

### Purpose
Captures the exact anonymization policy used for the run.

### Contains
- layer selection
- enabled entity types
- confidence thresholds
- uncertainty handling
- pseudonymisation settings
- language configuration

### Why it matters
This file allows the run to be reproduced exactly in the future.

---

## model_inventory.json

### Purpose
Documents which detection models were used.

### Contains
- engine version
- model providers
- model identifiers
- model hashes when applicable

### Why it matters
Supports transparency, audits, and AI governance requirements.

---

## run_report.json

### Purpose
Provides a human readable summary of the run.

### Contains
- run identifier
- timestamp
- selected layer
- summary counts per entity type
- number of processed files
- batch metadata if applicable
- language selection

### Why it matters
This is the primary overview document for stakeholders.

---

## findings.csv

### Purpose
Records every detected entity instance.

### Contains
- file identifiers
- entity types and priorities
- detected text
- confidence scores
- detection source
- applied redaction action
- language context

### Handling guidance
This file contains original personal data.
It should be treated as sensitive and access restricted.

---

## input_manifest.json

### Purpose
Documents which inputs were processed without leaking paths.

### Contains
- input folder basename
- file identifiers
- cryptographic hashes
- skipped file information

### Why it matters
Ensures traceability without exposing filesystem metadata.

---

## output folder

### Purpose
Contains redacted copies of the input files.

### Characteristics
- Original files are never overwritten
- Filenames may be modified to indicate redaction
- Structure is flat or controlled by batch logic

---

## logs folder

### Purpose
Reserved for operational logs.

### Characteristics
- No personal data by default
- Used for debugging and support
- Optional in current versions

---

## Reproducibility Guarantees

A run can be reproduced if:
- the same input files are available
- the same preset is used
- the same models are installed

The artifacts in the run folder provide all required information.

---

## Legal and Compliance Notes

- Findings reports remain personal data
- Redacted outputs may qualify as anonymised
- Responsibility for sharing remains with the user

---

## Summary

Run artifacts are first class outputs of the Legal Anonymizer.
They exist to ensure accountability, transparency, and trust.
